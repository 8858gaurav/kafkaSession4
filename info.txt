Bootstrap servers : Say we have a 100 node kafka cluster, it is not
possible to give the IP addresses of all these, rather we provide the IP
address of a few servers. The client can connect to one of these servers
and get to know all the metadata of the other brokers in the cluster.

producer.produce(topic, key, value, callback) is an asynchronous
method used to produce the data to a given topic.

producer.poll() : the producer() method asynchronously sends the
messages and doesn’t wait for the acknowledgement if the message
was delivered. It will not execute the callback function. Therefore, the
poll() method is used wherein the producer checks for any
asynchronous events that need to be processed. Events include
acknowledgement from brokers for messages sent / error. These
messages are polled when the poll() method is executed.

producer.flush() : This method is called prior to shutting down the
producer to ensure all outstanding/ queued/ in-flight messages are
delivered.
